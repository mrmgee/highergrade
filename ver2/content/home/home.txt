Abouttxt: 

## At Higher Grade, we pride ourselves on providing premium quality cannabis with exceptional service

Higher Grade was founded to give Denver residents a break from the hassle of medical and recreational combination stores. We take our time to make all patients feel welcome and appreciated. Pair that with the Olio and Green Dot concentrates and the best cannabis around and you have a dispensary that is worth a visit.

Test2txt: If you're a quality kind of person this is your stop. The dankest live resin and nug run I've smelled in a while. I'll for sure be back in the future. The bud tenders are very knowledgeable and even friendlier than they are knowledgeable

----

Test3txt: I had learned about this dispensary through instagram and immediately some of the genetics grabbed my attention. I stopped in and the bud quality was killer! Each strain looked and smelled fantastic! I recommend stopping by to check out their great selection!

----

Test4txt: What I love most is they have great strains not your basic menu like every other spot. Hope they keep bringing in new Funk as I will definitely continue to stop by!! Cheers guys, you are doing it right!!!

## Founders
Our founders started Higher Grade, in early 2017, after seeing and hearing from countless medical patients that Denverâ€™s medical market was dying. With the rise and dominance of recreational, many facilities simply cannot devote the time and attention to medical patients that was required. 
So, in 2017, Michael Lebowitz and Conor Scanlon, took their decades of growing expertise and turned it into Higher Grade +18 Medical Dispensary.
